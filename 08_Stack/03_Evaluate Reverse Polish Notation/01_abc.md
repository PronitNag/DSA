# Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Evaluator - Multiple Solution Approaches

## Problem Statement 📝

**LeetCode 150: Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation**

You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation. Evaluate the expression and return the result as an integer.

**Notes:**
- Valid operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`
- Operands can be integers or expressions
- Division truncates toward zero
- No division by zero will occur
- Input is a valid RPN expression
- All calculations fit in 32-bit integers

## Four Solution Approaches 🛠️

### 1. Stack-Based Solution (Most Efficient)

The stack approach is the most straightforward and efficient for RPN:

```python
def evalRPNusingStack(tokens):
    """
    Evaluates a Reverse Polish Notation expression using a stack data structure.
    This is the most common and efficient approach for RPN calculation.
    
    Args:
        tokens: List[str] - Array of strings representing the RPN expression
        
    Returns:
        int - The evaluated result of the RPN expression
        
    Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of tokens
    Space Complexity: O(n) in worst case, where n is the number of tokens
    """
    stack = []  # Initialize an empty stack to hold operands during calculation
    
    for token in tokens:  # Process each token in the input array one by one
        if token in ["+", "-", "*", "/"]:  # Check if the token is an operator
            # Pop the top two operands from stack (order matters for - and /)
            second_operand = stack.pop()  # Right operand (popped first)
            first_operand = stack.pop()   # Left operand (popped second)
            
            # Perform the operation based on the operator token
            if token == "+":
                stack.append(first_operand + second_operand)
            elif token == "-":
                stack.append(first_operand - second_operand)
            elif token == "*":
                stack.append(first_operand * second_operand)
            elif token == "/":
                # Python's division behavior is different than the problem requires
                # We need to truncate toward zero, not floor division
                result = int(first_operand / second_operand)
                stack.append(result)
        else:
            # If the token is an operand, convert it to integer and push to stack
            stack.append(int(token))
    
    # After processing all tokens, the final result will be the only item on stack
    return stack[0]  # Return the evaluation result
```

### 2. Recursive Solution

```python
def evalRPNusingRecursion(tokens):
    """
    Evaluates a Reverse Polish Notation expression using recursion.
    This solution recursively processes the tokens, evaluating as it goes.
    
    Args:
        tokens: List[str] - Array of strings representing the RPN expression
        
    Returns:
        int - The evaluated result of the RPN expression
        
    Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of tokens
    Space Complexity: O(n) due to the recursion stack
    """
    def evaluate(index):
        """

        Args:
            index: The current position in the tokens list
            
        Returns:
            Tuple[int, int] - (result, new_index)
        """
        # Base case: if we reach the end of tokens
        if index >= len(tokens):
            return None, index
            
        token = tokens[index]  # Get the current token
        
        # If the token is an operator, we need to evaluate its operands
        if token in ["+", "-", "*", "/"]:
            # Recursively evaluate the two operands that should come before
            right_operand, right_index = evaluate(index - 1)
            left_operand, left_index = evaluate(right_index - 1)
            
            # Perform the operation
            if token == "+":
                result = left_operand + right_operand
            elif token == "-":
                result = left_operand - right_operand
            elif token == "*":
                result = left_operand * right_operand

        else:
            # If the token is an operand, return its value
            return int(token), index + 1
    
    # Note: This recursive approach as shown doesn't work directly with the given
    # problem format. A more complex recursive approach would be needed.
    # This is more of a conceptual demonstration.
    
    # For a working recursion, we'd need to modify tokens or use a different approach
    tokens.reverse()  # Reverse tokens for easier recursive processing
    result, _ = evaluate(0)
    return result
```

### 3. Brute Force Solution

```python
def evalRPNusingBruteForce(tokens):
    """
    Evaluates Reverse Polish Notation expression using a brute force approach.
    This approach repeatedly scans the array to find operators and operands.
    
    Args:

    Returns:
        int - The evaluated result of the RPN expression
        
    Time Complexity: O(n²) where n is the number of tokens
    Space Complexity: O(n) to store the modified tokens list
    """
    # Make a copy of tokens that we can modify
    working_tokens = tokens.copy()
    
    # Continue until there's only one token left (the final result)
    while len(working_tokens) > 1:
        # Scan the tokens to find the first operator that has two operands before it
        for i in range(2, len(working_tokens)):
            if working_tokens[i] in ["+", "-", "*", "/"]:
                # Make sure the two preceding tokens are operands (numbers)
                if working_tokens[i-2].lstrip('-').isdigit() and \
                   working_tokens[i-1].lstrip('-').isdigit():

                    break
    
    # The only remaining token is the final result
    return int(working_tokens[0])
```

### 4. Doubly Linked List Solution

    """
    Node class for doubly linked list implementation.
    Each node holds a value and references to previous and next nodes.

## Step-by-Step Evaluation (ASCII Art Evolution) 🎬

Let's visualize the evaluation of `["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"]` using the stack solution:

```
Step 1: Process "2"
+--------+     +--------+
| Stack  | --> | Stack  |
|        |     |   2    |
+--------+     +--------+

Step 2: Process "1"
+--------+     +--------+
| Stack  | --> | Stack  |
|   2    |     |   2    |
|        |     |   1    |
+--------+     +--------+

Step 3: Process "+"
+--------+     +--------+
| Stack  | --> | Stack  |
|   2    |     |   3    |  (Popped 2 and 1, calculated 2+1=3, pushed 3)
|   1    |     |        |
+--------+     +--------+

Step 4: Process "3"
+--------+     +--------+
| Stack  | --> | Stack  |
|   3    |     |   3    |
|        |     |   3    |
+--------+     +--------+

Step 5: Process "*"
+--------+     +--------+
| Stack  | --> | Stack  |
|   3    |     |   9    |  (Popped 3 and 3, calculated 3*3=9, pushed 9)
|   3    |     |        |
+--------+     +--------+

Final Result: 9

## Pseudocode for Stack Solution 📝

```
Function EvaluateRPN(tokens):
    Create empty stack
    
    For each token in tokens:
        If token is an operator (+, -, *, /):
            Pop the top two values from stack (secondOperand, firstOperand)
            Perform operation: firstOperand operator secondOperand
            Push result back to stack
        Else (token is an operand):
            Convert token to integer
            Push integer to stack
    
    Return the only value remaining in stack
```

## Hindi-English (Hinglish) Explanation 🗣️

Stack approach RPN solve karne ka sabse accha tarika hai. Isme hum tokens ko ek
ek karke process karte hain. Agar token number hai to stack mein push kar dete 
hain. Agar token operator hai to stack se do numbers pop karte hain aur operation
perform karke result phir se stack mein push kar dete hain. End mein stack mein 
sirf ek hi number bachega jo final result hoga. Ye O(n) time complexity mein 
complete ho jata hai aur code bhi simple rehta hai. Recursion approach bhi accha
hai lekin thoda complex ho jata hai implementation. Brute force approach sabse 
inefficient hai kyunki isme hume bar bar array scan karna padta hai. Doubly 
linked list ka use karke bhi solve kar sakte hain par vo unnecessary complexity
add karta hai.

## Example Test Cases 🧪

```python
# Test case 1
tokens1 = ["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"]
print(f"Result of {tokens1}: {evalRPNusingStack(tokens1)}")  # Expected: 9

# Test case 2
tokens2 = ["4", "13", "5", "/", "+"]
print(f"Result of {tokens2}: {evalRPNusingStack(tokens2)}")  # Expected: 6

# Test case 3
tokens3 = ["10", "6", "9", "3", "+", "-11", "*", "/", "*", "17", "+", "5", "+"]
print(f"Result of {tokens3}: {evalRPNusingStack(tokens3)}")  # Expected: 22
```

## Conclusion 🏁

The stack-based approach is the most efficient and natural way to evaluate RPN expressions. It directly mimics how RPN is meant to be calculated, with O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity. While other approaches like recursion, brute force, and doubly linked list can work, they add unnecessary complexity or inefficiency.

When implementing an RPN evaluator, always remember:
1. Process tokens left to right
2. Push operands onto the stack
3. When encountering an operator, pop the required operands, perform the operation, and push the result back
4. The final result is the only value left on the stack
